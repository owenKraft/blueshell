2. The script should include comments when necessary, however, the comments should not be overly verbose or distracting from the script.
3. Follow PowerShell best practices and conventions
4. Provide any necessary explanations or warnings about script usage
5. Format your response with the script in a code block using 'powershell' syntax highlighting

If you need any clarification about the requirements, ask the user before generating the script.`;
